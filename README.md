# My_Suite
My_Suite is going to be a desktop app with a multitude of options, it will be a host of different applications providing help with your personal life. It will be, in effect, YOUR suite to customise, utilise and enjoy. 
Eventually once I have sorted some form of hosting, the idea will be, a simple login to the MySuite app on any desktop will allow you to adjust/view your plans at any time.

The Suite will sit on the desktop or be opened as needed, a dashboard will greet you with the different applications available to you. These will include, but not limited to:

Calander: 
    - To-Do's, 
    - Events,  
    - Planning/Suggestions, 
    - Family Calanders

Finance: 
    - Track multiple accounts, 
    - Track ingoings and outgoings, 
    - Provide graphical information to help with budgeting, 
    - Integration with the calander to allow for better financial planning

Cloud Storage/Family DropBox:
    - Allow families/friends to share files with each other
    - Can be used as a mutual gallery for photo storage/sharing
    - Calander integration can allow for photos to track to days and maybe eventually add in some fancy design stuff
